I am an undergraduate Finance major with a Computer Science minor. 
I have taken Computer Science I, Computer Science II: Data Structures, 
Embedded Linux, and C/C++ programming courses, all taken here at SUNY New Paltz. 

I have written many programs in Java based on class assignments, and worked collaboratively 
with peers on a "Magic Mirror" project in my Embedded Linux class in which we created a mirror 
that could display temperature, time, a welcome message, and live trending twitter moments, 
using a Raspberry pi 3+. The programming languages I've used were python, Java, HTML, C, and C++.
 
Being a Finance major, I was very interested in learning that we would be creating an e-commerce 
website because that would allow me to use my knowledge of financial methods and marketing to make
the website as successful as possible. I also would like to take the knowledge I gain in web programming 
to be able to potentially creating websites that can provide me monetary gain in the future.
